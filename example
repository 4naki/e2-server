Hello, this is naki. In case you are wondering, yes this is a server thing made in e2. Link below.

https://github.com/4naki/e2-server

You may not be able to read all of this in chat, but i promise you this, this is kinda cool.

You can either take data from websites and use that as the data on the e2 server like i am doing right know with github,
To do that i just took the "raw" link of this file. But you can also remove the DataLink and http request stuff and just change Data = to what you want it to be.
